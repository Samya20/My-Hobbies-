<h1>Welcome to My Page About Hobbies</h1>

<p>One of my best hobbies is learning new things because it gives me experience about things I didn't know before. I want to experiment with coding, as I'm studying IT for the first time. This is my first web page, and I hope I can get better in the future and improve my coding skills. Learning IT is very interesting because it opens many opportunities for me and helps me understand how technology works in our daily lives. I also enjoy reading books and cooking, because these hobbies make me relaxed and happy. In the future, I want to combine my hobbies with my studies and create useful websites.</p>
